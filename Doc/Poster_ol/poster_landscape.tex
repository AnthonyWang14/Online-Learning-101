  \headerbox{Probability Extraction}{name=prob, column=0, below=algorithm, above=bottom}{
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
We use [Vovk09] to extract probability estimation from odds. Given the odds ($o_h, o_d, o_a$), solve $\gamma$ such that:
\[\frac{1}{{{o_h^\gamma }}} + \frac{1}{{{o_d^\gamma }}} + \frac{1}{{{o_a^\gamma }}} = 1\]
Then we have $P_h = o_h^{-\gamma}$, $P_d = o_d^{-\gamma}$, $P_a = o_a^{-\gamma}$.

    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \headerbox{Loss Function}{name=loss, column=1}{
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The proposed loss functions are minimised when the predicted distribution coincides with the true probability distribution ( {\bf Proper Scoring Rule}).

\vspace{0.2cm}
{\bf Brier Loss}

In this case the target distribution ${\delta _\omega}$ is a Dirac distribution concentrated at the actual outcome y of the match.

\[\ell \left( {\gamma ,\underline \omega  } \right) = \sum\limits_{\omega  \in \Omega } {{{\left( {\gamma \left( \omega  \right) - {\delta _{\underline \omega  }}\left( \omega  \right)} \right)}^2}} \]
{\bf Calibration Loss}

A forecaster is $\epsilon$-calibrated if:
\[P\left( {\omega  = \omega_*|\gamma \left( \omega_* \right) \in \left[ {p - \varepsilon ;p + \varepsilon } \right]} \right) \approx p,\varepsilon  > 0\]

In practise, reality does not reveal the true probability distribution. But we can approximate through relative frequency $ $ and use it as target distribution. 
Thus the calibration loss function can be defined as
\[\ell \left( \gamma  \right) = \sum\limits_{\omega  \in \Omega } {{{\left( {{{\hat P}_\omega } - \gamma \left( \omega  \right)} \right)}^2}} \]
Multiple loss functions can be derived by replacing the $l2$ norm.

    \item[-] Bookmakers provide biased probability estimation.
    \item[-] A profitable margin exists for carefully designed betting strategies even without the integration of event features. Although it is very small compared with bookmakers' own profit estimation.
    \item[-] Measurement based solely on calibration without resolution for probability forecasting can be misleading.
